## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/impexbw/tradepilot.git
cd tradepilot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your Python dependencies. If you don't already have `venv` installed, you can install it by running:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Next, create a virtual environment in the project directory:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Project
After installing the dependencies, you can run the project by executing:

```bash
python run.py
```

Replace `run.py` with the actual entry point of your project if it's different.

### 5. Deactivating the Virtual Environment
When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
deactivate
```
